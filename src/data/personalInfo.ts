Since then, I've had the privilege of working with industry leaders like Agoda, DBS Bank, Talentica Software, and Intellect Design Arena, solving complex technical challenges and driving digital transformation. I'm deeply passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies like AI and automation to create solutions that not only meet business objectives but exceed expectations. Building a Java-ChatGPT email analysis system that saved $3.5M annually at Agoda is one of many examples where innovation meets real-world impact.",
      "I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and SOLID principles. System design is at the heart of everything I do‚ÄîI focus on building fault-tolerant, highly available systems that scale effortlessly. Beyond technical excellence, I value collaboration and mentorship. I've mentored over 5 junior engineers, reducing their ramp-up time from six weeks to four weeks through structured onboarding programs. I thrive in Agile, cross-functional teams where continuous learning and knowledge sharing drive collective growth.",
